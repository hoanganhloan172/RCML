_RCML intuition: For a batch of input images, the models `f` and `g` need to agree on a subset, which contains only the correctly annotated images._

## Description

We propose a multi-label learning method based on the idea of co-training for scene classification of remote sensing (RS) images with noisy labels. It identifies noisy samples and excludes them from back-propagation, aiming to train the classifier solely with clean samples. It also predicts the most noisy label in each sample.

Two Deep Neural Networks are trained with the same architecture simultaneously. The model is enhanced with a discrepancy module to make the two networks learn complementary features of the same data, while ensuring consistent predictions. This is achieved by creating a statistical difference between the logits of the two networks through the maximum mean discrepancy distance, and then converging the outputs of the networks using the same distance. Learning complementary features allows the two networks to correct each other by selecting clean instances with the loss information provided by the opposite network, and only using the clean instances to update their weights. The proposed method can also identify noisy labels in samples using the group lasso method. It can weigh the potential noisy samples down or up according to the noise type that they include.

## Dependencies
The code in this repository has been tested with `Python 3.6.9`. To run it, the following packages must be installed:
- `tensorflow==2.3.0`
- `tensorflow-addons==0.11.2`
- `scikit-learn==0.24.2`


## Datasets
We have tested the method on two different RS datasets: [BigEarthNet](http://bigearth.net/) and [UC Merced Land Use dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html). This repository supports different versions of these datasets:
- BigEarthNet with a 12 class-nomenclature
- BigEarthNet with a 19 class-nomenclature
- BigEarthNet with a 43 class-nomenclature
- UC Merced Land Use dataset annotated with multi-labels provided [here](https://bigearth.eu/datasets)

To use BigEarthNet, three [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord) are needed: `train.tfrecord`, `val.tfrecord` and `test.tfrecord`. The path to the directory containing the three files must be provided as `dataset_path` in the command line arguments.

The UC Merced Land Use dataset is loaded through [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) files. To use it, 6 pickle files must be created: `namely x_train.pickle`, `x_validation.pickle`, `x_test.pickle`, `y_train.pickle`, `y_validation.pickle`, `y_test.pickle`. The directory with these 6 files must be provided as `dataset_path` in the command line arguments.

## How to run
`pip install -r requirements.txt && cd script/ucmerced && ./run.sh`
